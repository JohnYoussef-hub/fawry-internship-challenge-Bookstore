# Quantum Bookstore â€“ Fawry N2 Dev Slope Challenge

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-blueviolet)

This is my personal solution for the **Fawry N2 Dev Slope #10 Challenge**.  
The project is built using Java and simulates a basic online bookstore system with inventory and purchasing logic.

## Project Summary

A console-based Java application that allows users to:

- Add books to an inventory.
- Handle paper books, eBooks, and demo (non-sellable) books.
- Validate stock availability and user balance.
- Send paper books via shipping and eBooks via email.
- Purchase books using ISBN, quantity, email, and address.
- Remove outdated books based on publication year.
